# Background

The world of GIS software is vast and dark.
The software and utilities out there are powerful, but written in the language of Mordor.
Calling them often requires to learn new frameworks, find the lost documentation, and prototype endless code that will never be used.
Even if you succeed, your ears will blast and your soul will be lost.
As I found that most of the commonly used routines are quite easy to implement, I started implementing them in C++ for speed.
I then packaged them and the end result was squirrygis.
squirrygis is still a work in progress: I add new routines as I need them.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```
